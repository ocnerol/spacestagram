## Design Inspiration

The user interface of the application is inspired by the album cover for [<i>Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space</i> by Spiritualized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladies_and_Gentlemen_We_Are_Floating_in_Space). For the full experience, check out [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iB7E1D_3Na4) from the album while exploring the photos of the universe.
